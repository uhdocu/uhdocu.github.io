# uhdocu.github.io

This is the uhdocu.github.io README. What is uhdocu.github.io? It is a WIP Roblox Revival Sharing Repo that allows users to obtain, use, and learn how to set up Roblox Revivals through many sources. Using a premade source is highly advocated against, but using them for private or for small revivals as a learning tool until you create your own revival is not a bad way to do so, and that is why I created uhdocu.github.io

If you want to add revivals or have any questions, please DM me on Discord @e0tn. Thank you!
